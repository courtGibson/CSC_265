<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p> The visualization in Figure 1 has Cairo's five qualities of great visualizations. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>It is truthful. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>It contains data gathered from research done by the World Health Organization (WHO). </li>
      </ul>
    <li> It is functional. </li>
       <ul>
          <li>The data is depicted accurately and allows the viewer to easily understand what the research found. There are                           high rates of antibiotic resistance bacteria from many different countries. It takes longer to create a new antibiotic                    than it takes for the bacteria to become resistant. </li>
       </ul>
    <li>It is beautiful.</li> 
       <ul>
         <li>The colors work nicely together, it is divided into different sections effectively, it is pleasing to look at,                           and easy to read.  </li>
       </ul>
    <li>It is insightful.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Countries with a lower GDP per capita still have high rates or antibiotic resistant bacteria. Also, different bacteria                    have higher resistance rates in different countries.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>It is enlightening.<li> 
         <ul>
           <li>Antibiotics only work to fight bacterias, and even certain types of bacterias. They are frequently prescribed                            when people have a viral infection, and not a bactiral infection. By prescribing them too often, we have created "super                  bugs". It can take around 15 years to make a new antibiotic. Bactria can become resistant in only 10 years. If we keep                   using antibiotics too often, we will create more and more super bugs and won't be able to fight them soon enough.  </li>
         </ul>
  </ol>

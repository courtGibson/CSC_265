<h2>Data Sets</h2>
<p>The first dataset I found is located at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/the-abc-of-gender-equality-in-education-aptitude-behaviour-confidence . This data set was compiled after a large study of gender in education. It found that men and women perform equally in science in grade school. Only 14% of women choose to pursue STEM majors while 40% of men do. The study also provides data on women's confidence in STEM and expectations held by their family. This data could be used to show a relation between the number of women in STEM and the causes. </p>
<p>The second dataset I found is located at https://www.education-inequalities.org/indicators/slevel_upsec . This data shows the relationship between academic achievement, gender, economic background, and other factors. I will use this dataset to provide more information on the achievement level of students from different backgorunds and compare each gender to the other.</p>

<p>Two mistakes people make when making map graphs include using circles and cloropleth maps. When using circles, you need to make sure you are accurately representing the data. You should increase the area of the circle and not the diameter. Increasing the diameter based on your data will result in a circle that is to large comparatively. When using cloropleth maps, you need to be careful about generalizations. If you are showing statistics about a state, the population might be dense in one aread and not in others. This may make the whole state show a certain value but if you broke it down to counties you would be able to see that most of the data was from a specific area and not representative of the entire state. </p>

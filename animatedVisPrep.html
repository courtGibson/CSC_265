<h1>Animated Data Visualization</h1>
<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/space/keplers-tally-of-planets.html">link to animated visualization</a>
<br>
<p>This data visualization includes the following elements:
<ul>
<li>A list of stars that have planetary systems that can be arranged by system size or discover date</li>
<li>The size of the circles representing the stars and planets are relative to their real life sizes</li>
<li>The size of the radius is relative to the real life radius of each planet</li>
<li>The speed of the orbit of each planet is relative to the real orbital speed</li>
<li>If the system is a binary star system, two stars are shown orbiting a central point at a relative speed</li>
<li>If you hover over one of the systems, there is a pop up of information that includes the systems name and how many planets there are</li>
<li>Depending of who much is known about the system, more information may pop up in the form of descriptions or images</li>
</ul>

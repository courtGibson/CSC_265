    <p> One type of data that would make a good force diagram would be a family tree. You can map all of the connections between family members. The edges would be parent/child relationships and the node would be people. Also, you can make a map of a college campus. The edged would be paths between buildings and the nodes would be buildings. A thrid graph you could make would be a map of a computer network. You could make the connections of wifi locations in a building. The nodes would be wifi locations and the edges could be the distance from the network source.

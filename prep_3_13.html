<h3>Why is visualization effective?</h3>
<p>Humans are good at understanding values when there are round numbers involved. For example, we understand where a grade falls 
on a scale of 0 to 100, but if the scale were different, it is harder to think about. By making vizualization, we can take the 
guess work away from our brain and allow it to interpret an image. We can see the differences in height or size and make judgements this
way. If the data is not something we experience daily, like a grade, we will be able to understand it quickly with a vizualization.</p>

<h3>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?</h3>
<p>Cairo states you should map data into visual properties. You have to think about what you are trying to convey before you can pick
what type of graph to use. The graphs will differ if you are going for general ideas or specific relationships.</p>

<h3>What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization</h3>
